Based on your actual data, here are queries that will definitely work:
1. Total Events
promqlsum(falco_events)
2. Events by Priority (for pie chart)
promqlsum by (priority) (falco_events)
3. Events by Rule (to see which rules triggered)
promqlsum by (rule) (falco_events)
4. Critical Events Only (priority=2)
promqlsum(falco_events{priority="2"})
5. Events Over Time (for line graph)
promqlsum(rate(falco_events[1m]))
6. Top 10 Rules
promqltopk(10, sum by (rule) (falco_events))
